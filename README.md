1. **2D Clicking Game** : A classic and simple example of evolving generations. In this game, when the user clicks on a spawned agent/person it gets destroyed. The coming generations evolve to camouflage themselves to the background so that the user finds it harder to identify them and they can live longer. 

2. **Beam Balancing** : A 3D character learns to walk on a beam without falling off, using the principles of evolution.
